The system uses a Trie (Prefix Tree) where each node represents a single character.

Words are inserted into the Trie by creating child nodes for each character if they do not already exist.

Common prefixes share the same nodes, allowing node reuse and efficient storage.

For search or auto-suggestion, the Trie is traversed character by character based on the input prefix.

Once the prefix node is reached, a depth-first traversal is performed to collect all valid words starting from that prefix.

Each complete word is identified using an end-of-word flag stored in the Trie nodes.


# Key points of this project 

Prefix lookup runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string.

Trie structure avoids repeated string comparisons and enables efficient prefix-based search, making it suitable for this use case.
