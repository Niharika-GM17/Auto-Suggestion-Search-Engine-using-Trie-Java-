This project implements an auto-suggestion search engine using the Trie data structure in Java to support fast prefix-based search.

The application stores and retrieves strings efficiently by traversing Trie nodes character-by-character, enabling quick lookup and suggestion generation. The implementation focuses on clean data structure design, correct handling of edge cases, and efficient traversal logic.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of core DSA concepts, including Trie construction, prefix matching, node reuse, and time complexity analysis.
